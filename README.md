# Overview

# Talk about what you are trying to accomplish as a software engineer to further your learning.
One thing I'm trying to accomplish as a software engineer is to be able to make useful impact in the field of technology, being able to create web applicaton and or useful
software that will make daily task easy for end users concern. In order to be able to accomplish this, learning specific languages for different task function
is very much important in my career part. You cannot talk to a software engineer without asking about their programming, logical, and technical problem solving skills.

# Provide a description of your software

For the Data Analysis project, I will be writing a software in python to analyze a set of data, and in the process, I will demonstrate the ability to filter, sort, aggregate (sum, average, count), or data conversion. And eventually 
represent my data in graph or charts.

- Web App (Calculator)
- Data Analysis (Python)
- Cloud Database
- Language - Kotlin: Part of my project will involve the use of Kotlin language
- Mobile App

# Describe your purpose for creating this software.

For the sake of this assignment, I'm learning how to use Python in solving data anaylitical problems. So far this semester as part of my team project, part of the task is to create a machine learning model that will help identify similar features or characteristic of 
individual and match them in the same category. The web application for making friends that we are building as a team will contain a survey page which will take user input base on interest and personality, and the information will be used by the machine learning model 
that we are creating to match individual base on similar interest. So as part of my personal project, I thought I could learn more by doing data analysis in python.


## Provide a link to your YouTube demonstration.  It should be a one minute demo of the software running and a walkthrough of the code.

This will be provided as the program is completed and running.

# Development Environment
for the development environment, I used Visual Studio Code as my editor.

# Describe the tools that you used to develop the software

For this softwar, I will be using an existing data set from JSON Dataset


# Describe the programming language that you used

Python 

Json
